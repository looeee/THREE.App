      Include the main three.js script.

      The global variable THREE will be
      available for use in any scripts
      loaded after this one.

    -->

    <script src="https://threejs.org/build/three.js"></script>

    <!--

      Include the OrbitControls script.

      This must be included AFTER the three.js script as it
      needs to use the global THREE variable

    -->

    <script src="https://threejs.org/examples/js/controls/OrbitControls.js"></script>

		<!--

			Include the GLTFLoader script. This also needs to be loaded after the three.js script

		-->

		<script src="https://threejs.org/examples/js/loaders/GLTFLoader.js"></script>

		<!--

			Include three-app from the App.js file. This will add THREE_APP as a global variable,
			window.App, so make sure that this doesn't cause any conflicts!

		-->
